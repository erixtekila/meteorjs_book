## Pourquoi meteor ?

[7 Principles of Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/sevenprinciples)


1. **Data on the Wire**. Meteor doesn't send HTML over the network. The server sends data and lets the client render it.3. 
2. **One Language**. Meteor lets you write both the client and the server parts of your application in JavaScript. 
3. **Database Everywhere**. You can use the same methods to access your database from the client or the server.
4. **Latency Compensation**. On the client, Meteor prefetches data and simulates models to make it look like server method calls return instantly.
5. **Full Stack Reactivity**. In Meteor, realtime is the default. All layers, from database to template, update themselves automatically when necessary.
6. **Embrace the Ecosystem**. Meteor is open source and integrates with existing open source tools and frameworks.
7. **Simplicity Equals Productivity**. The best way to make something seem simple is to have it actually be simple. Meteor's main functionality has clean, classically beautiful APIs.
